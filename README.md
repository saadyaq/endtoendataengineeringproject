## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to establish a robust pipeline that ingests unstructured data in real-time, processes it efficiently, and applies machine learning models to extract meaningful insights. This system is designed to handle diverse data formats and provide scalable processing capabilities.

## Architecture

The architecture comprises the following components:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Utilizes Apache Kafka to collect and transmit unstructured data from various sources.
2. **Stream Processing**: Employs Apache Spark Streaming to process data streams in real-time.
3. **Data Storage**: Stores processed data in a suitable database or file system for further analysis.
4. **Machine Learning Integration**: Applies pre-trained machine learning models to analyze and interpret the data.
